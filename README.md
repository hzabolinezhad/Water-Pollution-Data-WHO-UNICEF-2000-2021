Water Pollution Data (WHO/UNICEF) | 2000-2020
About this Repository
This repository contains data and analysis related to the water pollution dataset obtained from WHO/UNICEF. The dataset covers the years 2000 to 2020 and provides information on global access to clean drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene.

The goal of this repository is to spread awareness about the global water pollution issue and encourage data analysts and scientists to work on this problem.

Dataset Description
The dataset contains information on drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene for several regions in the world, as well as aggregate values for the world as a whole. The data is divided into categories of household, schools, and healthcare, with some countries having data on inequalities as well.

Research Questions:
1-How has global access to clean water and sanitation changed from 2000 to 2020?

2-Is there any correlation between global access to clean water and sanitation?

3-How has regional access to clean water and sanitation changed over the years?

4-Are there significant inequalities in access to clean water and sanitation within different regions?

5-How does access to clean water and sanitation differ between high-income and low-income regions?

Note
Because the original dataset consists of about 65 excel files each of which concludes many tabs. To answer the research question,  I extracted the two questions_assossiated tabs from two different mega files and then converted them to CSV format, and work on them (region_houshold_sanitation, region_houshold_water). Here is the link access to these files if you would like to execute the code and see the output.   https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DYeHlooW6nQ3q_oOnY7qhtlNUyM3yz33?usp=share_link
